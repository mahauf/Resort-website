## How to Use

It's plain HTML and CSS really. You don't need to install or learn any frameworks. As long as you know how to edit HTML and CSS, you can start customizing our templates right away. We made our templates black and white for a reason, so you can customize them the way you want more easily. Think of it as a wireframe. Change the images, copy, typefaces, etc. Add some background colors, gradients, box shadows, etc. We use CSS variables of course.
